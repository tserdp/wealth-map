## Interactions

- All displayed planning fields are editable.
- Changes update the shared working state and all dependent pages.
- Invalid ages or percentages show validation feedback.

## Implementation note

The shipped Plan Setup page also includes a "Tax and retirement settings" section with State, Tax filing status, Social Security benefit mode (Automatically estimate by default, or Enter manually), Social Security Full Retirement Age benefit (read-only estimate in auto mode, editable in manual mode), and Social Security claim age (62-70, default 67) always visible, plus a collapsible "Advanced Tax & Retirement Settings" section for less commonly changed assumptions. This wireframe predates that structure; see [wireframe-navigation.md](wireframe-navigation.md) and the shipped `index.html` for the current layout.
