# Wealth Map Wealth Timeline Wireframe

The Wealth Timeline is the detailed retirement-planning workbench. It lets users inspect the shared projection year by year, compare planning strategies, and make isolated overrides when their real situation differs from the default assumptions.

## Page responsibilities

- Show the projected asset path from the current age through life expectancy using the same timeline engine that feeds Readiness and Recommendations.
- Summarize ending assets, projected depletion, and the number of ages with local overrides.
- Expose Social Security and Roth conversion strategy selectors without duplicating Plan Setup fields.
- Show the read-only Social Security comparison for ages 62 through 70, with the active claim age and Full Retirement Age clearly identified.
- Surface major modeled events through milestone cards, including retirement, Social Security, the first RMD, the first IRMAA year, portfolio peak, and depletion when present.
- Show portfolio composition snapshots for the current modeled year, retirement start, first RMD year when present, and life expectancy. Real estate remains separate from spendable financial assets.
- Provide editable year-by-year detail so users can reconcile individual years without rewriting shared profile assumptions.

## Interactions and state

- `Reset timeline overrides` clears every per-age override and rerenders the Timeline and all dependent views. The global `Reset sample data` control also clears overrides and restores the immutable sample profile.
- Blank override fields fall back to the modeled value for that age. An override is stored at one age only and must not change any other age.
- Return overrides apply to that year's expected return. Income overrides apply during working years. Spending and extra-withdrawal overrides apply during retirement years. Controls that do not apply to the row's phase are disabled or read-only.
- Entering, changing, or clearing a valid override recalculates the shared model and updates Readiness, Recommendations, milestones, composition snapshots, summary metrics, and the affected annual row without a page reload.
- A row with any override receives a visible non-color-only indicator and exposes a clear action. Clearing the row restores all of its fields to modeled values.
- Social Security comparison values are read-only illustrative estimates. The selected manual or model-recommended claim strategy is shown separately from the comparison and is not presented as optimization advice.
- Roth conversion strategy choices are labeled as manual or model-recommended. The model-recommended strategy remains an estimate based on current assumptions.
- Invalid, negative, non-finite, or out-of-range values must show an understandable validation state and must never produce `NaN` or a broken table.
- The detail table remains horizontally scrollable within its own region on narrow screens; the page itself must not require horizontal scrolling. Sticky headers and readable row labels should remain usable on desktop and mobile.

## Calculation contract

- `buildTimelineRows(profile)` produces one row per age from current age through life expectancy.
- Accumulation rows apply growth, contributions, taxes, and the configured conversion strategy. Retirement rows apply Social Security, RMDs, IRMAA, spending, withdrawal sequencing, and cash-reserve behavior.
- Retirement withdrawals use the documented order: cash, brokerage, pre-tax accounts grossed up for withdrawal tax, then Roth. RMDs are removed from pre-tax balances whether or not they are needed for spending.
- The cash reserve refills from brokerage only after a positive-return year. A down year must not force a brokerage refill solely to restore the reserve.
- Timeline summaries and milestone values must be derived from the same rows rendered in the detail table. No Timeline metric may be hard-coded or calculated by a separate retirement model.
